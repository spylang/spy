## What is SPy?

TL;DR: SPy is a variant of Python specifically designed to be
statically compilable **while** retaining a lot of the "useful" dynamic parts
of Python.

It consists of:

  1. an interpreter (so that you can have the usual nice "development
     experience" that you have in Python)

  2. a compiler (for speed)

The documentation is very scarce at the moment, but the best source to
understand the ideas behind SPy are:

  - blog post [Inside SPy, part 1: Motivations and Goals](https://antocuni.eu/2025/10/29/inside-spy-part-1-motivations-and-goals/)

  - PyCon Italy 2025 talk: [slides](https://antocuni.eu/talk/2025/05/spy-pycon-italy/) and [recording](https://youtu.be/W-8tgZDgYmw).

  - PyCon US 2024 talk: [slides](https://antocuni.pyscriptapps.com/spy-pycon-2024/latest/) and [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnQ0oJ_yXlw&ab_channel=PyConUS).
